## Description

SteelShield is a DDOS protection system designed for the specific purpose of protecting game servers from large scale DDOS
attacks. It achieves this by intercepting network traffic on the path to the game server, and identifying wether the
combination of source address, destination address, port and network packet contents match the type of packets which
would normally be expected for that game server.

The SteelShield Plugin for Unreal Engine enables better and more accurate packet matching by the SteelShield service.
This is achieved by having a backend system, typically the *game server*, authenticate the client via a
username/password account system, and then issue the *game client* a *JWT* containing the account and game details, and
signed with a *certificate* that is shared between the game author and Nitrado.

This *JWT* is then submitted to the *SteelShield Token Service* by the *game client*, where the certificate and game
credentials are validated, and a *SteelShield Token* is issued to the *game client*.

This *SteelShield Token* is then prepended to all network packets sent by the *game client*, where the *SteelShield
Service* is able to intercept them, and validate that the prepended *SteelShield Token* matches one that was issued by
the *SteelShield Token Service*.

Should the *SteelShield Token* be missing, or not match one issued by the *SteelShield Token Service*, then the network
packet is dropped by the *SteelShield Service* and is never received by the *game server*.

This ensures that large DDOS attacks from botnets or via reflection attacks are prevented from reaching the *game
server* as they would not have been able to go through the authentication process to receive a valid *SteelShield Token*
which allows their traffic to pass through the *SteelShield Service*

Should an attacker perform the authentication process and then use their received *SteelShield Token* is used in an attack,
the *SteelShield Token* would be able to be traced back to that individuals account, and the user banned.

*SteelShield Tokens* are also set to *roll over* every 15 minutes (by default) in order to ensure that the token can not
be used in future DDOS attacks.
