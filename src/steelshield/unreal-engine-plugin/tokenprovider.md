# Token Provider

The Token Provider is the system responsible for acquiring or generating the *JWT* which is issued to the *SteelShield
Token Service*.

There are 2 Token Provider implementations which are supplied with the *SteelShield Plugin*, but the plugin integrator
is able to develop their own Token Provider that works with their backend should they have a custom backend solution.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is advised that as much of the authentication and JWT generation as 
> possible is done on the game backend server so that attackers are not 
> able to reverse engineer and extract certificates on the client side 
> in order to generate valid tokens that can be used in an attack. 

## EOS Token Provider

The EOS Token Provider requires integration of the game with Epic Online Services. The EOS is then used to extract a JWT
which has been generated by the Epic Servers and can be trusted and authenticated by the *SteelShield Token Service*.

It is recommended to use the Redpoint EOS plugin in order to implement EOS services in the game, as SteelShield has been
extensively tested with this implementation.

## Default Token Provider

The Default Token Provider can be used in testing environments, but due to its insecure nature of including the
*Certificate* in with the *Game Client*, it is not reccommended for production use.

This token provider uses the *Certificate* and information provided in the SteelShield Plugin Settings to generate and
sign a JWT locally without needing to communicate with a remote backend server
