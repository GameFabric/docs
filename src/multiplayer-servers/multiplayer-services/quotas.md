## Logging Limitations

Limits for game server logging apply both *per game server* and *globally*. Exceeding the limits will cause log lines to be dropped.
Burst amounts allow for temporarily exceeding rate limits, for example if the logging frequency is higher during start up.

### Log Throughput per Game Server

- **Limit**: 100 lines per second per game server (with a burst size of 500 lines)
- **Description**: If a game server exceeds this logging rate, additional log lines may be dropped.

### Global Log Throughput

- **Limit**: 10 megabytes per second globally (with a burst size of 50 megabytes)
- **Description**: If your aggregated log stream exceeds this rate, additional log lines may be dropped.

## Additional Information

For questions about increasing these limits or if you encounter other limitations not documented here, please contact GameFabric support.
