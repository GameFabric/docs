# Accessing GameFabric programmatically

Beside the UI we offer additional more programmatically ways to work with GameFabric.

## API

GameFabric offers API access to every feature. Please see our dedicated [GameFabric API Guide](/multiplayer-servers/api/guide) for more information.


## Terraform Provider
