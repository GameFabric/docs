# Monitoring & Logs

Each GameFabric installation comes with its own dedicated monitoring solution.
This setup includes a personal Grafana installation.
This Grafana instance provides visibility into the system's performance and operations.
It monitors all metrics generated by the platform and related services and provides access to all your gameserver logs from one central location.


To access it simply click on "Monitoring".

## Metrics
There are metrics for every feature of the product.
There are a lot of predefined dashboards under "Dashboards".

## Logs
Everything that the gameserver prints to either `stdout` or `stderr` will be collected automatically.
