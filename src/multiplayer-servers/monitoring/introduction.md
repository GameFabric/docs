# Monitoring & Logs

Each GameFabric installation comes with its own dedicated monitoring solution.
This setup includes a personal Grafana installation.
This Grafana instance provides visibility into the systems performance and operations.
It monitors all metrics generated by the platform and related services and provides access to all your gameserver logs from one central location.
