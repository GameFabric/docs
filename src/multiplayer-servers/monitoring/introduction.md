# Monitoring & Logs

Each GameFabric installation comes with its own dedicated monitoring solution.
This setup includes a personal Grafana installation.
This Grafana instance provides visibility into the systems performance and operations.
The Grafana dashboard allows you to monitor all metrics generated by the platform and related services and provides access to all your game server logs from one central location.


To access it simply click on "Monitoring".

## Permissions
To access monitoring, a user must belong to a `group` with a `role` that has at least `GET` permission for the `monitoring` resource.


Users with `POST` permission can create custom dashboards and alerts.

## Metrics
There are metrics for every feature of the product.
There are a lot of predefined dashboards under "Dashboards".

## Logs
Everything that the game server prints to either `stdout` or `stderr` will be collected automatically.
