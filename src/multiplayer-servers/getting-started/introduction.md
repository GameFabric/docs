# Introduction

GameFabric is an orchestration platform for [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/docs/)-based game servers across Bare Metal and Cloud. It provides a web interface to manage game server deployments across multiple regions, along with many practical features to allow you to have complete control over your game servers.

You can also manage GameFabric resources programmatically through:

- [REST API](/multiplayer-servers/api/guide) — for custom integrations
- [Terraform provider](/multiplayer-servers/integration/terraform) — for Infrastructure as Code

::: tip Key Concepts
To better understand GameFabric, we recommend reviewing the [Glossary](/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary) for definitions of key terms like Armadas, Formations, Vessels, and Fleets.

You should also familiarize yourself with the [hosting models](/multiplayer-servers/architecture/identifying-your-hosting-model) (Armadas vs Formations) to choose the right approach for your game.
