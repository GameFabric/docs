# Introduction

GameFabric is a Developer-First Multiplayer Server Orchestration Platform across Bare and Cloud.

GameFabric is based on [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/docs/), which it wraps with additional layers of orchestration across multiple regions, web interfaces, observability and many other features.
GameFabric also comes with a [REST API](https://docs.gamefabric.dev/api) and a [Terraform provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform).

This documentation is meant to guide you through the setup and usage of GameFabric, from the initial setup of
your Cloud capacity to the deployment of your game servers.
