# Introduction

GameFabric is a Developer-First Multiplayer Server Orchestration Platform across Bare and Cloud.

GameFabric is based on [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/docs/), which it wraps with additional layers of orchestration across multiple regions, web interfaces, observability and many other features.
GameFabric also comes with a [REST API](https://docs.gamefabric.dev/api) and a [Terraform provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform).

This documentation is meant to guide you through the setup and usage of GameFabric, from the initial setup of your Cloud capacity to the deployment of your game servers.

::: tip Key Concepts
To better understand GameFabric, we recommend reviewing the [Glossary](/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary) for definitions of key terms like Armadas, Formations, Vessels, and Fleets.

You should also familiarize yourself with the [hosting models](/multiplayer-servers/hosting-models/identifying-your-hosting-model) (Armadas vs Formations) to choose the right approach for your game.
