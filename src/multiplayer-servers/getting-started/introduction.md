# Introduction

GameFabric is an orchestration platform for [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/docs/)-based game servers across Bare Metal and Cloud. It provides a web interface to manage game server deployments across multiple regions, along with many practical features to allow you to have complete control over your game servers.

You can also manage GameFabric resources programmatically through:

- [REST API](/multiplayer-servers/api/guide) — for custom integrations
- [Terraform provider](/multiplayer-servers/integration/terraform) — for Infrastructure as Code

::: tip Key Concepts
To better understand GameFabric, reviewing the [Glossary](/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary) provides definitions of key terms such as Armadas, Formations, Vessels, and Fleets.

Familiarity with the [hosting models](/multiplayer-servers/architecture/identifying-your-hosting-model) (Armadas vs. Formations) is also important when selecting the appropriate approach for a game.

For games that use matchmaking, consult [Server Allocation](/multiplayer-servers/multiplayer-services/server-allocation/overview) to understand how players are assigned to servers.
