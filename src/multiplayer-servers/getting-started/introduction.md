# Introduction

GameFabric is an orchestration platform for [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/docs/)-based game servers across Bare Metal and Cloud.
It provides a web interface to manage game server deployments across multiple regions, along with many practical features to allow you to have complete control over your game servers.

GameFabric also comes with a [REST API](https://docs.gamefabric.dev/api) as well as a [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/GameFabric/gamefabric) and an [OpenTofu provider](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/gamefabric/gamefabric/latest).

This documentation is meant to guide you through the setup and usage of GameFabric, from the initial setup of your Cloud capacity to the deployment of your game servers.

::: tip Key Concepts
To better understand GameFabric, we recommend reviewing the [Glossary](/multiplayer-servers/getting-started/glossary) for definitions of key terms like Armadas, Formations, Vessels, and Fleets.

You should also familiarize yourself with the [hosting models](/multiplayer-servers/architecture/identifying-your-hosting-model) (Armadas vs Formations) to choose the right approach for your game.
