# Introduction

GameFabric is an orchestration platform for [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/docs/)-based game servers across Bare Metal and Cloud.
It provides a web interface to manage game server deployments across multiple regions, along with many practical features to allow you to have complete control over your game servers.

This documentation is meant to guide you through the setup and usage of GameFabric, from the initial setup of your Cloud capacity to the deployment of your game servers.
